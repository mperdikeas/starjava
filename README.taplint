To only build the taplint jar and dependencies, execute the following commands:

./build-custom-ant
. ./set-star-environment.sh
ant build

    ... when the above build ultimately fails with:

        "/starjava/frog/src/main/uk/ac/starlink/frog/util/JPEGUtility.java:3: error: package com.sun.image.codec.jpeg does not exist"

    ... then, do a final build of some targeted projects, which should succeed:

./build-taplint-deps
