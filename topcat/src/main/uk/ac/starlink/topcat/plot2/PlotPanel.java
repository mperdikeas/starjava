/**
 * Component which paints plot graphics for Topcat.
 * This is the throbbing heart of the plot classes.
 *
 * <p>It is supplied at construction time with various objects capable of
 * acquiring (presumably from a GUI) information required to specify a plot,
 * and its {@link #replot replot} method conceptually acquires
 * all that information and prepares a plot accordingly.
 * The plot is cached to an icon (probably an image) which is in
 * turn painted by <code>paintComponent</code>.
 * <code>replot</code> should therefore be called any time the plot
 * information has changed, or may have changed.
 *
 * <p>In actual fact <code>replot</code> additionally
 * spends a lot of effort to work out whether it can avoid doing some or
 * all of the work required for the plot on each occasion,
 * by caching and attempting to re-use the restults of various
 * computational steps if they have not become outdated.
 * The capability to do this as efficiently as possible drives quite a bit
 * of the design of the rest of the plotting framework, in particular
 * the requirement that a number of the objects determining plot content
 * can be assessed for equality to tell whether they have changed
 * materially since last time.
 *
 * <p>This component manages all the storage and caching of expensive
 * (memory-intensive) resources: layer plans and data stores.
 * Such resources should not be cached or otherwise held on to by
 * long-lived reference elsewhere in the application.
 *
 * <p>This component also manages threading to get computation done
 * in appropriate threads (and not on the EDT).  At time of writing
 * there are probably some improvements that can be made in that respect.
 *
 * <p>This component is an ActionListener - receiving any action will
 * prompt a (potential) replot.
